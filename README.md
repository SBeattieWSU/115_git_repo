# Online Platform Use Among Teens

## Motivation
I wanted to explore data that pertained to social media usage among U.S. teens. I had a particular focus on comparing social media usage between boys and girls, and see if there were any differences or similarities worth learning. The question I was looking to answer was "between boys and girls, which has a higher percentage of online platform use?" Considering our modern day and age, online platform usage is a very relevant topic in accordance to U.S. teenagers, and is frankly somewhat concerning considering how much social media makes up a teenager's life.

## Data Sources
I started off by typing into the web browser Google Chrome "Online Platform Use Among Teens." As expected, many results came up; many of which had interesting data that I could have used. I ended up choosing the first link "pewresearch.org" and clicked the first visual that appeared. After looking through the various visuals, the seventh page had information that peaked my interest. It was titled "Online platform use among U.S. teens, by demographic group," and it included data gathered from a survey focused on voluntary participants. I saw the potential for analysis, and thus selected the variables and values to use for my project. Since I couldn't find a way to properly convert the data into a csv (comma separated file), I had to manually create a csv on GitHub in my repository. Since my original question pertained to social media usage among boys and girls, I used the "U.S. teens," "Boys," and the "Girls" rows and left the remaining rows out. I drew from the data all of the social media platforms formatted as columns, and after coding a csv file for the data I selected, it created a 3 by 8 table displaying "U.S. teens," "Boys," and the "Girls" rows with the 8 columns pertaining to the social media platforms.
